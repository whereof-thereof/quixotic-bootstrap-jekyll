#Quixotic Bootstrap Jekyll

##Intro

Named Quixotic Bootstrap Jekyll because it was built principally using Bootstrap, Jekyll and a bunch of other things (see list of Things), this is a smash-and-grab Jekyll theme much like Poole or Jekyll Bootstrap. The quixotic part comes from wanting to throw in all sorts of funky things, because reasons.

##Things

This repo has things in it, which I didn't write myself but have been formally permitted to use. These things are as follows:

* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) (v.3.3.4)
* I've gone ahead and used [Noto Sans from Google/Fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts#UsePlace:use/Collection:Noto+Sans)
* ...and so on

##Requirements

If you're running straight offa GitHub Pages, you're grand.

If you're running local, you'll need:
* Probably Git
* Jekyll (plus dependencies)
* Jekyll sitemap
* SASS

##Notes & disclosures

- This isn't anywhere near ready.
