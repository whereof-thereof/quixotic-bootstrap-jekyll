#Quixotic Bootstrap Jekyll

##Intro

Named Quixotic Bootstrap Jekyll because it was built principally using Bootstrap, Jekyll and a bunch of other things (see list of Things), this is a smash-and-grab Jekyll theme much like Poole or Jekyll Bootstrap. The quixotic part comes from wanting to throw in all sorts of funky things, because reasons.

##Things

This repo has things in it, which I didn't write myself but have been formally permitted to use. These things are as follows:

* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)
* [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) (v.3.3.4)
* I've gone ahead and used the [Lato font from Google/fonts](https://www.google.com/fonts#QuickUsePlace:quickUse/Family:Lato)
* I'm going to incorporate [OnePageScroll](https://github.com/peachananr/onepage-scroll) and I'm just getting around to that any day now
* ...and so on

##Requirements

If you're running straight offa GitHub Pages, you're grand.

If you're running local, you'll need:
* Probably Git
* Jekyll (plus dependencies)
* Jekyll sitemap
* SASS

##Other notes & disclosures

- I took a few liberties with the `<blockquote>` styling. If you hate the way I handled it, the code is labelled clearly enough in the `public/css/style.scss` file.
